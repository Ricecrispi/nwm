# nwm game

This is a project run by the Software Engineering Lab at University of Toronto, and is being developed by undergraduates. 

N-way model merging (nwm) is the problem of merging sets of software models into one. The problem is NP hard, making it impossible to automate. Currently, the only algorithms available to solve nwm are heuristic, which don't always guarantee an optimal solution. We are creating a serious game to gauge how well humans can perform nwm--to possibly use human beings to merge software models in the future.
