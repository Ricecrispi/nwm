              <p>Matchmakers is a serious game ("game with a purpose") that uses human visual cognition to solve “n-way model merging”; a problem that computers cannot efficiently solve. N-way model merging (nwm) is the process of combining several models of software into one. It is considered an important aspect of software engineering.
