              <h1>Game Objective</h1>
              <p>In the game, you are presented with many aliens are asked to match aliens that share similar properties.
              The object of the game is to produce optimal groupings—groupings that have the highest degree of similarity.
                </p>

              <p>
                Here is an alien:
              </p>

              <p>Here is another alien that is similar to the first alien. They both have.</p>


              <p>Here is another alien that is even more similar to the first alien. They both have. This pair makes up a more optimal grouping that the previous pair. In the game, you want to match aliens that are as similar as possible.
              </p>

              <h1>What makes aliens similar?
              </h1>

              <p>For aliens to be similar, they have share identical properties (i.e. if two aliens have the exact same bracelet, they are considered similar). Aliens that share similar but not identical properties are not considered similar (i.e. if two aliens are wearing bracelets, but the bracelets are different, they are not considered similar unless they have other features in common).
</p>
              <p>Furthermore, this is a base alien with no properties.
</p>
              <p>As you can see, it is already wear a helmet, shirt, shorts, boots, and socks. These items should not be considered common attributes when you are identifying similar aliens.
</p>
              <h1>Game Walk-through</h1>
              <p>
              1)	Choose your game version. You can either play from the current best solution, in which the game will be pre-loaded with groupings from the current best solution, continue from your previously saved state, or start from scratch.
              <br>2)	Scroll through the game screen to look for aliens that share similar properties.
              <br>3)	Create a new group. (When you start the game, a new empty group is already made for your so you don’t have to make one yourself).
              <br>4)	Add an alien to a group by clicking on it. Aliens from the same group will have the same colored background.
              <br>5)	Remove an alien from a grouping by clicking on it again.
              <br>6)	Aliens that are similar to your current group are highlighted with a yellow border.


              <br>You can also view these aliens all at once on the side panel.

              <br>7)	Some aliens are enemies, and are not allowed to be placed into the same group. Aliens that are not allowed to be placed into the same group will have a striped background like so:.

              <br>You can still add striped aliens to a group, but you will be prompted to remove its enemies first:

              <br>8)	View your score.
              <br>9)	Undo/redo your actions.
              <br>10)	 Select a group that was previously created (do this if you want to go back to a group to add/remove aliens from it).

              <br>You can see what group is selected below your score. The small box below “CURRENT GROUP” displays the color of your current group.
