              <h1>Game Objective</h1>
              <p>In the game, your task is to match aliens that share similar properties.
                The object of the game is to produce optimal groupings—groupings that have the highest degree of
                similarity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here is an alien.
              </p>
              <img class="smaller" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/training11.png"/>
              <p>Here is another alien that is similar to the first alien. They both have a red diamond.</p>
              <img class="smaller" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/training.png"/>
              <p>Here is another alien that is even more similar to the first alien. They both have the same tail and hairstyle. This pair makes up
                a more optimal grouping that the previous pair. In the game, you want to match aliens that are as
                similar as possible.
              </p>
              <img class="smaller" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/training12.png"/>
              <br>
              <h1>What makes aliens similar?
              </h1>

              <p>For aliens to be similar, they have to share identical properties (i.e. if two aliens have the exact same
                bracelet, they are considered similar). Aliens that share similar but not identical properties are not
                considered similar (i.e. if two aliens are wearing bracelets, but the bracelets are different, they are
                not considered similar unless they have other features in common).
              </p>
              <p>Furthermore, this is a base alien with no properties.
              </p>
              <img class="smaller" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/none2.png"/>
              <p>As you can see, it is already wear a helmet, shirt, shorts, boots, and socks. These items should not be
                considered common attributes when you are looking for similar aliens.
              </p>
              <h1>Game Walk-through</h1>
              <p>
                1) Choose a game setting. You can either play from the current best solution, in which the game will
                be pre-loaded with groupings from the current best solution, continue from your previously saved state,
                or start from scratch.
                <br>
                <img class="large" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/game_versions.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>2) Scroll through the game screen to look for aliens that share similar properties.
                <br>
                <img class="large" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/similar_find.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>3) Create a new group. (NOTE: When you start the game, a new empty group is already made for your so you
                don’t have to make one yourself).
                <br>
                <img class="large" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/control_panel_create.png"/>
                <br>
                You can see what your current group is in the small box below “CURRENT GROUP”, which displays
                the color of your current group.
                <br>
                <img class="large" src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/control_panel_current.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>4) Add aliens to a group by clicking on them. Aliens from the same group will have the same colored
                background.
                <br>
                <img src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/add.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>5) Remove an alien from a grouping by clicking on it again.
                <br>
                <img src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/remove.png"/>
                <br>

                <br>6) Aliens that are similar to your current group are highlighted with a yellow border.
                <br>
                <img src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/similar_aliens.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>You can also view these aliens all at once on an adjustable side panel.
                <br>
                <img src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/panel.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>7) Some aliens are enemies, and are not allowed to be placed into the same group. Aliens that are
                not allowed to be placed into the same group will have a striped background like so:
                <br>
                <img src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/striped_aliens.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>You can still add striped aliens to a group, but you will be prompted to remove its enemies first:
                <br>8) View your score.
                <br>
                <img src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/score.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>9) Undo/redo your actions.
                <br>
                <img src="http://individual.utoronto.ca/myricecrispi/game/undo_redo.png"/>
                <br>
                <br>10) End game (to either save your game for later, submit your score, or quit the game without saving).
                <br>
